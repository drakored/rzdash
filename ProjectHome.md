**Update:** I'm currently working on an alternative solution which will be 100% custom built (hardware and software). This will be much more stable, have instant boot and still be cheap. I will post more info soon.

RzDash is a software which allows the user to watch his engine constants in real time.

It was originally built to work with modified (chipped) OBD0/1 Honda ECUs through the dataloging serial port. So far, eCtune and Chrome are supported, as well as a basic support of the AEM EMS. (This needs some testers)

Some other interfaces are being developped:
- OBD2 (standard, not car specific)
- Hondata KPRO
- Hondata S300
- Motec

Plans are to port it to android (still running as a QT app)
This way it will run on Tablets (MIDs like Ipad) and cellphones.

You can try the windows version, in the download section.
